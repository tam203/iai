The primary aim was to establish a centralized data repository, facilitating access for researchers to utilize both the data and metadata derived from the satellites for future research.\\n\\nAlouette -1 was the first topside ionospheric satellite and the first Canadian satellite launched in 1962 in collaboration with the United States through NASA. Alouette – 1 was known for its swept frequency topside sounder experiment with the goal to investigate the geographic and diurnal variation of the topside ionosphere at altitudes up to 1000 km. One of the most important scientific results from Alouette-1 was that it provided the first global picture of electron-density distribution in the topside ionosphere. With the success of Alouette -1, Canada and the United States formally agreed on December 23rd, 1963, to extend their collaboration to a program called International Satellites for Ionospheric studies (ISIS). As part of this program, Canada designed and built an additional family of ionospheric satellites: Alouette – 2, ISIS -1 and ISIS – 2. The ISIS - 1 and ISIS - 2 satellites had a more complex navigational systems and larger data collection capabilities than Alouette- 1 and 2 satellites. For instance, ISIS – 1 was the first in the series to contain a swept and fixed frequency sounder technique combined with a complete set of direct measurements.\\n\\nThe output from the topside sounders were a video signal that contained the ionospheric echo pulses, but also pulses that depicted frequency markers and when a new frame started. A system was built to read the 7-track reel-to-reel magnetic tapes displayed on a cathode ray tube in ‘B-scan’ form. This product was called an ionogram, which depicted the reflections of radio waves emitted from the satellite off the top side of the ionosphere, across a range of frequencies. The scanning of the ionograms as the first step of the historical data restoration of the Alouette and ISIS satellites began in 2017. The processing of the Alouette \\n and ISIS data was concluded in 2023 and 2024 respectively. \\n\\n&gt; Canadian Space Agency has created a centralized repository, facilitating easy access for researchers to utilize both the data and metadata derived from the Alouette and ISIS satellites. This includes but is not limited to open-source code on the processing of the data, raw images, data dictionaries, detailed methodology and a micro application that provides users the ability to select, download and visualize Alouette and ISIS data.\\n\\n\\n## How to Get Started\\n**To learn how to access, work and re-process the data, read:**\\n\\n- [**Alouette-1 – Ionogram Data Extraction Methodology**](https://github.com/asc-csa/Alouette_extract/blob/working/documentation/Alouette-1%20-</td>\n",

The primary aim was to establish a centralized data repository, facilitating access for researchers to utilize both the data and metadata derived from the satellites for future research.\\n\\nAlouette -1 was the first topside ionospheric satellite and the first Canadian satellite launched in 1962 in collaboration with the United States through NASA. Alouette – 1 was known for its swept frequency topside sounder experiment with the goal to investigate the geographic and diurnal variation of the topside ionosphere at altitudes up to 1000 km. One of the most important scientific results from Alouette-1 was that it provided the first global picture of electron-density distribution in the topside ionosphere. With the success of Alouette -1, Canada and the United States formally agreed on December 23rd, 1963, to extend their collaboration to a program called International Satellites for Ionospheric studies (ISIS). As part of this program, Canada designed and built an additional family of ionospheric satellites: Alouette – 2, ISIS -1 and ISIS – 2. The ISIS - 1 and ISIS - 2 satellites had a more complex navigational systems and larger data collection capabilities than Alouette- 1 and 2 satellites. For instance, ISIS – 1 was the first in the series to contain a swept and fixed frequency sounder technique combined with a complete set of direct measurements.\\n\\nThe output from the topside sounders were a video signal that contained the ionospheric echo pulses, but also pulses that depicted frequency markers and when a new frame started. A system was built to read the 7-track reel-to-reel magnetic tapes displayed on a cathode ray tube in ‘B-scan’ form. This product was called an ionogram, which depicted the reflections of radio waves emitted from the satellite off the top side of the ionosphere, across a range of frequencies. The scanning of the ionograms as the first step of the historical data restoration of the Alouette and ISIS satellites began in 2017. The processing of the Alouette \\n and ISIS data was concluded in 2023 and 2024 respectively. \\n\\n> Canadian Space Agency has created a centralized repository, facilitating easy access for researchers to utilize both the data and metadata derived from the Alouette and ISIS satellites. This includes but is not limited to open-source code on the processing of the data, raw images, data dictionaries, detailed methodology and a micro application that provides users the ability to select, download and visualize Alouette and ISIS data.\\n\\n\\n## How to Get Started\\n**To learn how to access, work and re-process the data, read:**\\n\\n- [**Alouette-1 – Ionogram Data Extraction Methodology**](https://github.com/asc-csa/Alouette_extract/blob/working/documentation/Alouette-1%20-   \n",
