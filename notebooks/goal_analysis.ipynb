Moreover, this task is made more difficult due to optimizations, architectures and compilers diversity, custom implementations, obfuscation, ...\\n\\nTools have been developed to automate this task.

Moreover, this task is made more difficult due to optimizations, architectures and compilers diversity, custom implementations, obfuscation, ...\\n\\nTools have been developed to automate this task.
